# Let-s-Recycle-Image-Classification-System-for-Waste-Sorting
The "Let's Recycle" project aims to assist consumers in determining whether their waste is recyclable or non-recyclable using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model implemented in TensorFlow. The project achieved 98% accuracy in a 2-class model and 83% accuracy in a 4-class model.
### Samsung AI Cohort 2022
This project was a part of the Samsung Artificial Intelligence Cohort 2022. The cohort provided training and mentorship to work on AI-based projects that contribute to solving real-world problems. Over the course of six months, our team worked together to design, develop, and implement the image classification system presented here.
