# Let-s-Recycle-Image-Classification-System-for-Waste-Sorting
The "Let's Recycle" project aims to help consumers easily determine whether their waste is recyclable by using an image classification system. This system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow to classify waste materials into recyclable and non-recyclable categories, with an accuracy of 98% on a 2-class model and 83% on a 4-class model.
